_Basic_ Android equation solver (with OCR capabilities)

(CS241 Honor session final project)

General Idea:
======
1. Take a picture for a simple equation. 
2. The appp solves the equation.
3. Print result

Project Log:
======
Week one: (2014-10-26 ~ 2014-11-1):

- Prepare to start.
- setup environment.
- Install sdk & ndk.
- Get android phone from cs inventory.

Week two: (2014-11-2 ~ 2014-11-8):

- Learn NDK tutorial
- Write sample codes followed by tutorial.
- Dicide project idea

Week three: (2014-11-9 ~ 2014-11-15):

- Find OCR (Optical character recognition) library which works for NDK (https://github.com/rmtheis/tess-two)
- Download the library and try to build in android phone.

Week four: (2014-11-16 ~ 2014-11-22):

- Daniel Xu:
	- After build the library successfully, design user interface for the application.
	- (To be added by Dan...)
	
- Yijun Zhang:
	- Try to find and download an possible equation solver API (wolframalpha API)
	- Write a simple equation solver library (like solving 12+x=20, y/12=96...), symbolic manipulation.

Week five: (2014-11-23 ~ 2014-11-29):

- Daniel Xu:
	- (To be added by Dan...)

- Yijun Zhang:
	- Add some simple calculation functionality (like solving 1+1, 1999/12, 123*321...) to simple solver library.
	- Testing

Week six: (2014-11-30 ~ 2014-12-6):

- Testing.
- Recording video.

Future possible improvement:
